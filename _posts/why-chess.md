## Why Chess

This is my most asked question.

Its 5000 years old. If you are familiar with the concept of Antifragile. This means that Chess is likely to outlast everyone you know.

Its fun.

But most importantly it teaches you that their is a 'next move' to look for. This is the skill that the grandmasters have acquired.



Let me back up a bit...

## The way that it works

The skill that grandmasters have acquired that you do not have... is that they have 'chunked' into their minds hundreds of thousands of positions into their mind.

They can therefore look at a board... and its as if they had a hud (heads up display).

So I figured... what would happen if you just cut out all of the chunking (since computers are pretty great at that)... and instead just got the benefit of being a grandmaster?

And you started practicing that meta game.

What happens to the amount of time that it takes you to acquire mastery?

I'm betting it gets reduced (although perhaps mastery will get redefined in the process).







It's an intersection between two very central human ideas. A lot of people (probably around either 80 or 20 percent) tend to perceive the world in real time. The other (80 or 20)

Chess can help you train the other half of your consciousness. Help you practice some skills that you are not naturally 'gifted' in (the entire concept of 'gifted' is actually not as cut and dry as you may think).

The study of expertise acquisition says that people can get better at whatever they train.

# -> 1 It's fun once you get decent

Once you understand the basic object of the game. Once you get even just 'ok' it is a truly fun and rewarding game that you will enjoy)


# -> 2 It teaches you how to think backwards (or forwards if you think backwards)


* Some people are playing the game thinking about their first move.
* Others are thinking about their last move.
* Which are you?

You will train both styles (you earn the one you prefer by playing the other)... its pretty motivating.

But first we have to guage your current biases.
